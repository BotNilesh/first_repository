# What is GitHub?
  GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
  It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
  
# Step 1. Create a Repository
  A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
  Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. 
  We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository.
  It also offers other common options such as a license file.
